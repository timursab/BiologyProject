    <div> A calorie is a unit of energy. 
        In nutrition, calories refer to the energy people get from the food and drink they consume,
        and the energy they use in physical activity.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>Most people only associate calories with food and drink, but anything that contains energy has calories. 
        1 kilogram (kg) of coal, for example, contains 7,000,000 calories.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>    
    <div>
        There are two types of calorie:
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        A small calorie (cal) is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram  
        of water by Celsius .
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        A large calorie (kcal) is the amount of energy required to raise 1 kilogram  of water by 1º C.
         It is also known as a kilocalorie.

        Daily requirement
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        The United States government states that the average man needs 2,700 kcal per day and 
        the average woman needs 2,200 kcal per day.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Not everybody needs the same number of calories each day. People have different metabolisms that burn energy at different rates, 
        and some people have more active lifestyles than others.

        Calories and health
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        The human body needs calories to survive. Without energy, the cells in the body would die,
         the heart and lungs would stop, and the organs would not be able to carry out the basic processes needed for living. 
        People absorb this energy from food and drink.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        If people consumed only the number of calories needed every day, they would probably have healthy lives.
         Calorie consumption that is too low or too high will eventually lead to health problems.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        The number of calories in food tells us how much potential energy they contain.
         It is not only calories that are important, but also the substance from which the calories are taken.
