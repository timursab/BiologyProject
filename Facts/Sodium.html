    <body id="body">
    <div>
            ‍ 
    </div>    
    <div> Sodium — often simply referred to as salt — is found in nearly everything you eat and drink.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>It occurs naturally in many foods, is added to others during the manufacturing process and is used as a flavoring agent at home and restaurants.
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>    
    <div>
        For some time, sodium has been linked to high blood pressure, which causes damage to your blood vessels and arteries when chronically elevated. In turn, this increases your risk of heart disease, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Therefore, several health authorities have established guidelines for limiting sodium intake.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        However, these guidelines have been controversial, as not everyone may benefit from a reduced-sodium diet.
    </div>
    <div>

        Necessary for Health
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Despite its continued vilification, sodium is a necessary nutrient for good health.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        It’s one of your body’s electrolytes, which are minerals that create electrically charged ions.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        A major source of sodium in most diets is added salt in the form of sodium chloride — which is 40% sodium and 60% chloride by weight.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Most of your body’s sodium resides in your blood and the fluid surrounding your cells, where it helps keep these fluids in balance.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Your kidneys help regulate your body’s sodium levels by adjusting the amount that is excreted in your urine. You also lose sodium through sweating.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div id="header3">
        Should You Limit Your Intake?
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        People with high blood pressure who consume more than 7 grams of sodium per day should certainly consume less.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        The same may apply if you have been instructed by your physician or registered dietitian to limit your sodium intake for medical reasons — as in the case of a low-sodium therapeutic diet.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        However, cutting back on sodium doesn’t seem to make much of a difference for healthy people.
