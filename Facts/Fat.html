            ‍ 
    </div>    
    <div> Along with protein and carbs, fat is one of the three macronutrients in your diet.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>You consume fat in the form of triglycerides. A triglyceride molecule consists of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone. The fatty acids contain chains of carbons and hydrogens.
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>    
    <div>
        One way to classify fats is by the length of their carbon chains:
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        short-chain fatty acids: fewer than 6 carbons
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        medium-chain fatty acids: 6–12 carbons
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        long-chain fatty acids: 13–21 carbons
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        very long-chain fatty acids: 22 or more carbons
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Most of the fats you eat are long-chain fatty acids. Short-chain fatty acids are mainly produced when bacteria ferment soluble fiber in your colon, although milk fat also contains small amounts.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Long-chain and very long-chain fats are absorbed into the bloodstream and released into the body’s cells as needed. However, the liver takes up short-chain and medium-chain fats directly and stores them as energy.
    </div>
    <div>

        Different types of fat
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Fatty acids are grouped according to the number of double bonds between carbons in their structures.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div class="heads">
        Monounsaturated fat
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) have one double bond in their carbon chains.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div class="heads">
        Polyunsaturated fat
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) contain two or more double bonds.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    <div class="heads">
        Saturated fat
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) have no double bonds in their carbon chains, so the carbons are said to be “saturated” with hydrogen.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        They’re very stable at high temperatures and far less likely to be damaged during cooking than polyunsaturated fats.
        Trans fat

        Trans Fat
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        In a trans fats molecule, hydrogens are positioned across from each other rather than side by side.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Small amounts of trans fats occur naturally in dairy and other animal foods. However, nothing is natural about the trans fats used in processed foods.
