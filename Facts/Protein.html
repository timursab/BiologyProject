    <div> Protein is considered the building block of life and is found in every cell of the body.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>Protein is made up of amino acids that are attached to one another in long chains. There are 20 different kinds of amino acids, and the sequence in which the different amino acids are arranged helps determine the role of that particular protein.

        Proteins play a role in:

        Without filling your diet with appropriate amounts of protein, you run the risk of missing out on those key functions. Eventually, that could lead to problems, such as a loss of muscle mass, failure to grow, weakened functioning of the heart and lungs, and even early death. (4)

        How Much Protein Do I Need for Optimal Health?
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Essential amino acids (the ones your body can’t make on its own and needs to get from food) can be found in the food you eat. To source them, you need to fill your diet with a variety of protein-rich foods, which isn’t hard to do since protein is naturally found in many nutritious foods — many of which are likely already part of your regular diet.
         When you eat, your body will take the protein from the food and break it down into amino acids that can be used by the body.

        How to Calculate Your Recommended Protein Intake  
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div> 
    <div>
        The Recommended Dietary Allowance (the amount to meet the nutritional needs of almost all healthy people) is 0.8 grams (g) of protein per kilogram (kg) of body weight.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        To calculate the target number of grams of protein you should eat each day, take your body weight in pounds and multiply it by 0.36. The result should get you within the recommendation to source 10 to 35 percent of your daily total calories from protein. 
    </div>  
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Keep in mind that these recommendations may change depending on age and health. The recommendation changes for athletes, too. People who exercise frequently or are training for a race need to increase their protein intake to between 1.1 and 1.7 g per kg of body weight daily. Anything over 2 g per kg of weight is considered excessive.
