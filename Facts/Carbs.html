    <div>Carbohydrates are a type of macronutrient found in many foods and beverages. Most carbs occur naturally in plant-based foods, such as grains. Food manufacturers also add carbs to processed foods in the form of starch or added sugar.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>Common sources of naturally occurring carbohydrates include:
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>    
    <div>
    Fruits,
    Vegetables,
    Milk,
    Nuts,
    Grains,
    Seeds,
    Beans, peas and lentils

        Types of carbohydrates
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        There are three main types of carbohydrates:
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Sugar. Sugar is the simplest form of carbohydrate. It occurs naturally in some foods, including fruits, vegetables, milk and milk products. 
        Types of sugar include fruit sugar (fructose), table sugar (sucrose) and milk sugar (lactose). Added sugars can be found in many foods, such as cookies, sugary drinks and candy.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Starch. Starch is a complex carbohydrate. This means it is made of many sugar units bonded together. Starch occurs naturally in vegetables, grains, and cooked dry beans and peas.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        Fiber. Fiber also is a complex carbohydrate. It occurs naturally in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and cooked dry beans and peas.
    </div>

    <div id="header3">
        How many carbohydrates do you need?
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that carbohydrates make up 45% to 65% of total daily calories.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        So if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbs a day.
    </div>
    <div>
        ‍ 
    </div>
    <div>
        You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label. The label shows total carbohydrates — which can include fiber, total sugars and added sugars.
